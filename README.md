## Task Overview

We would like you to implement a simple directory browser, using data from the following API:

[API Documentation](https://randomuser.me/documentation#howto)

The following requirements should be met:

1. The directory should be accessed via the /directory route (leaving existing content intact)
1. The main view should consist of a paginated list, showing a thumbnail, name and city for each person
1. It should be possible to view more detail for any person (either in a modal or detail panel) showing their address, email, phone number and date of birth

Consider the following in your implementation:

- Loading state
- Styling (see theme.ts for hints)
- Use of React Hooks

Extra credit for:

- Adding a search / filter
- Tests
- Accessibility
- Over-engineering - show off with some patterns and practices you would use in a more complex app
